# Expense Tracker App
Expense Tracker App

This is simply a React-Native reference app for me that is configured to use Typescript instead of javascript, 
and is setup to use Jest... with tests also written in Typescript. 

Apart from expo, there are a whole lot of installs required to get this working including a range of babel and jest configuration setting.
  
  npm install

  npm install -g expo expo-cli --save
  npm install expo expo-cli --save
  
  npm install --save-dev jest
  npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
  npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript
  npm install --save-dev ts-jest
